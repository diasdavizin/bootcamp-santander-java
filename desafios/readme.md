### Syntax - Challenge
Let's exercise all the content presented in the Syntax module by coding the following scenario.

1. Create the ContaBanco project that will receive data via terminal containing bank account characteristics according to the attributes below:

2. Within the project, create the ContaTerminal.java class to carry out all the coding of our program.
Review variable declaration rules

| Attribute   | Type    | Exemple       |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Whole       | Number  | 1021          |
| Agency      | Text    | 067-8         |
| Name Client | Text    | Mario Andrade | 
| Balance     | Decimal | 237.48        |

2. Allow data to be entered via the terminal and the user will receive a message stating which information will be requested, for example:
- Program: "Please enter the Agency number!"
- User: 1021 (then ENTER for the next field)

3. After all information has been entered, the system should display the following message:
- "Hello [Customer Name], thank you for creating an account with our bank, your branch is [Agency], account [Number] and your balance [Balance] is now available for withdrawal".

The fields in [ ] must be changed by the information entered by users.
